# YooChose-dataset-analysis
This repository deals with the analysis of youchoose dataset and compares some of the papers publised on Recomender sytems that have used it as a dataset. We try to find some patterns in data and try to draw some conclusions out of it. 

# Here are the links to papers I have mentioned in my Data analysis Code. 
1. Gated Graph Based RNN for Recomendations : Session-based Recommendation with Graph Neural Networks by Shu Wu et al
2. GRU4REC : SESSION-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS by Balazas Hidasi et al
3. STAMP : STAMP: Short-Term Attention/Memory Priority Model for Session-based Recommendation by Qiao et al
4. NARM : Neural Attentive Session-based Recommendation by Jing Li et al

#The abhove analysis has been done on processed data, the code for processing the youchoose dataset is in **preprocessing.py**.
